# ToDo-App-with-Firebase
Install NodeJs, Android Studio and React Native, Firebase
Firstly I made HomeScreen and ToDo List ,Items like a normal todo app, then with the help of react-native navigation I made Splash Screen which will show "ToDo App" for 3 second then it will open login page and if there is no user we need to click Create new Account which will open SignUp page.
Then I used react native firebase for creating user and login, I have just used the whole documentation and process given at their website then after login page will navigate to Home Screen where we can add n number of todo items which comes with a checkbox, if we clicked on checkbox the item will blur and cut itself and the users will receive the notification .
I have used firebase cloud messaging rest api notification which will send notification to each and every user, whose token is in the firebase database.
